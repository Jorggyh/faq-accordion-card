## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I noticed that the page was not keyboard accessible, so I searched and learned how to make elements focusable by
adding `tabindex="0"` inside the HTML TAG, in my case `span`.

I learned how to handle multiple selectors with `querySelectorAll` and `forEach`.
